for any floating point number you should have 17 significant digits

swith case for elapsed time
	have different versions for calculating time
	like:
	cpu_time()
	date_and_time()
	system_clock()
	system_clock()

lonely.c
set only the x1 to 3.2
let others be just a double
do comments like a box

Topic: Performance modeling and vector computers
basic single processor architecture ideas
using cache 

Linear algebra kernels
In modern applications all are sparse matrix operations

Chache
caches are 10x faster
2gz - 2billion clock ticks per sec. do 2billion operations per sec

Terminology:
clock cycle: basic unit of time for computer,
cache hit: the datum in the cache
cache miss: the datum is not in the cache
hits take 1-2 cycles; misses take 10-100cycles
cache line: when a word is referenced, an entire line of words is bought into the cache. Typically 32 - 128 bytes at a time.

relative cost of cache miss:
Cache modelling
cace hit ratio = (#hits) / (#refernces)
